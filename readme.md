# AI Background Remover

## Overview

AI Background Remover is a web-based tool that allows users to remove backgrounds from images using a simulated AI approach. This project demonstrates the frontend implementation of a background removal tool, providing a user-friendly interface for uploading images, adjusting removal settings, and downloading the processed results.

## Features

- Drag-and-drop or click-to-upload image functionality
- Interactive background color selection
- Adjustable color tolerance for fine-tuning results
- Real-time preview of background removal effect
- Option to save and download the processed image

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-background-remover.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd ai-background-remover
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

1. Open the application in a web browser.
2. Upload an image by dragging and dropping it onto the designated area or by clicking the "Select an image file" button.
3. Use the color picker to select the background color you want to remove.
4. Adjust the tolerance slider to fine-tune the removal effect.
5. The processed image will update in real-time as you make adjustments.
6. When satisfied with the result, click the "Save Processed Image" button to download the processed image.

## Technical Details

- The application is built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
- Background removal is simulated using a color-based approach with adjustable tolerance.
- The Canvas API is used for image processing.

## Limitations

- This is a frontend-only implementation and uses a simplified simulation of background removal.
- For best results, use images with solid color backgrounds.
- The tool may not perform well on complex images or those with gradients or intricate backgrounds.

## Future Improvements

- Implement a backend service with actual AI-based background removal.
- Add support for more complex background removal techniques.
- Implement additional image editing features (e.g., brightness/contrast adjustment, cropping).
- Optimize performance for processing large images.
